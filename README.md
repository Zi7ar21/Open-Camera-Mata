# Open Camera Mata
This repository contains a modified version of [Open camera](https://opencamera.org.uk/) optimised for the [Essential PH-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_Phone) [(Mata)](https://github.com/EssentialOpenSource/device_essential_mata) that includes support for the Monocrhome camera. [Reddit User u/comatrices](https://www.reddit.com/user/comatrices) initally created the replacement for `http://cameracontrollermanager2.java/` which allows the function of the Monochrome camera.
